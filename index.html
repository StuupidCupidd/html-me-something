         <h1 id="title">They Gave Me Glinting Gems</h1>
	   <h3>Most of us have movies they hold dear to them from when they were younger. 
Maybe you even have moments or imagery from these movies that stand out from the cloudy 
memories, brightly, like tiny gems to be kept safe in your heart. Here I'll be sharing 
with you a few of mine. </h2>

<h2><i>Alice in Wonderland</i><h2>

<p>From this bizzare and dreamlike movie, many portals to different moments and 
experiences came from the food and drink shown. Potions, cookies, and pebbles turned
 to cakes seen throughout this film still make younger me curious what could happen if 
I had a taste. On a greater scale, my fondness for this movie is no surprise when considered my love
for cute and quaint treats, shimmery and desaturated color schemes, and classical music.</p>

<h2><i>Wall-E</i><h2>

<p>Quiet with a cluttery home, Wall-E collects scraps and pieces of a world he was not a part of. They hold sentimental value
to him nonetheless, reminding me much of my thrifting habits- an ongoing collection of art, books, and clothes that remind me of times 
I have not seen in this lifetime. There is a certain charm that the items from the past hold, and this does
not go unnoticed in my appreciation for them.</p>

<h2><i>Dumbo</i><h2>

<img src="file:///C:/Users/sydne/LC101/html-me-something/images/dumbo.jpg.webp" alt="Dumbo being swaddled and rocked by his mother, through the bars of a cage"/>

<p>Dumbo is one of the first movies I remember watching. Some of my earliest memories are of me being held gently, and I hold those
memories dear to me. I see the younger me whose heart broke during this scene in myself now, who knows that Physical Touch is a 
preferred and important love language in my connections with those around me.

<footer>It is a bittersweet love, remembering what was that you will never have in that same way again. 
I pray my life allows me many more of these beautiful, tear-stained, kaleidescopic love notes to myself.</footer>
